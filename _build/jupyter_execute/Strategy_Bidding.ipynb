    "In Blue Club, we prefer bids that quickly narrow the possible strength of our hand in terms of points. The $1\\clubsuit$ bid identifies a strong hand but also limits all the other suit bids at the level of one. Responders bids also limit his hand in the same way, so the partnership quickly knows if they have the combined strength for game or slam.\n",
    "\n",
    "While strength in points is vital for a partnership, suits and fit are more important. Combined, a bridge partnership needs 8 trumps. Superfit of 9 or more trumps is worth a great deal, so early bids should be capable of alerting partner to interesting features like a long suit or, perhaps, a singleton or void suit."
