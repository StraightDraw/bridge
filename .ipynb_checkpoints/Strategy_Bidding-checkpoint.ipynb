    "Blue Club players prefer bids that narrow the possible strength of our hand in terms of points. The $1\\clubsuit$ bid identifies a strong hand but also limits the other suit bids at the level of one. Responder's bids also limit her hand, so the partnership quickly knows their combined strength.\n",

A <span style = 'color:blue;font-weight:bold'>superfit</span> of 9 or more trumps adds tremendous trick-taking power. Blue Club bids alert partner to interesting features like a long suit, a two-suiter or a void suit."
